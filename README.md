# Placing 3D objects in ARKit

This sample demonstrates using SceneKit and ARKit to place 3D models in an augmented reality environment.

It uses ARKit to detect a horizontal plane and then based on user input, it places a 3D model in the environment.


## What this sample demonstrates

## Implementation Details

### Placing the object on a horizontal plane


## Useful Resources

* [ARKit Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit)

* [WWDC 2017 - Session 602, Introducing ARKit: Augmented Reality for iOS ](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/602/)

## Requirements
### Running the sample

* For plane detection to work, you will need to view a flat and sufficiently textured surface through the on device camera while this sample is running.

### Build

Xcode 9 and iOS 11 SDK

### Runtime

iOS 11 or later

ARKit requires an iOS device with an A9 or later processor.
